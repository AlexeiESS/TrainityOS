 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

 The utilities included in this package allow you to partition
 your hard disk. The utilities supports both modern and legacy
 partition tables (eg. GPT, MBR, etc).
 .
 The fdisk utility is the classical text-mode utility.
 The cfdisk utilitity gives a more userfriendly curses based interface.
 The sfdisk utility is mostly for automation and scripting uses.

Description: GNU dbm database routines (translation files) 
 GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).
 This package provides translations for messages, generated by
 library routines and programs, provided by 'gdbtool' package.

 gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able
 to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
 and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys
 used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration
 files and only a few options are implemented.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Version: 1.0.4-2
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14)
Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.
